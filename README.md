## Sense Search Components
A collection of HTML/JavaScript APIs that allow you to leverage the power of the Qlik Sense QIX engine to embed search in to a Web application.

The components can be used with the Qlik Sense Capability API, a QSocks implementation or on own their own.

####Getting Started
To include the Sense Search Components in your Web application you will need to include references to the JavaScript API and the CSS file for styling. Be sure to add the JavaScript file at the end of the HTML body
``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rawgit.com/websy85/sense-search-components/master/build/sense-search.min.css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://rawgit.com/websy85/sense-search-components/master/build/sense-search.min.js"></script>
```
